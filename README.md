The goal of this project is to develop a medical chatbot that helps users query pharmaceutical product data in natural language. The chatbot handles both internal database queries and queries about medicines that are not part of the database by leveraging external agents. The system integrates various cutting-edge Large Language Model (LLM) application patterns, including Agent-based Design, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Prompt Engineering. The solution does not require fine-tuning of models but focuses on creating an intelligent, conversational assistant capable of assisting users with pharmaceutical queries.
This methodology outlines the steps involved in designing, implementing, and testing the chatbot, including dataset generation through web scraping, database creation, LLM-based query handling, and integration of external agents.
